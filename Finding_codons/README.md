 In the end it'll output a phrase with the follwoing points:
 
     -Name;
     -Lenght;
     -Cords;
     -Stop-codon,
     -Sequence.
     
 Example:

    AB211401.1 Panthera pardus orientalis mitochondrial cytb gene for cytochrome b, partial cds, specimen_voucher: PPA59 (National Cancer Center USA stock)    17    (25, -1)    TGA
